Synchronous vs Asynchronous

******* Django/Webpages mostly Synchronous
    1. Web synchronous request (HTTP request)
    2. send request -> stop executing -> wait for reply
    3. HTTP 200 (ok/ success) or HTTP 404 etc. (or timeout)

** Simple Term:
We send a msg/ req, (waiting period), then we get return. 
Then we send another msg/ req, (waiting period), then we get return.


******* Asynchronous
    1. Make request "launch" the request
    2. Forget about it -> carry on executing tasks
    3. Define/ create a callback function

** Simple Term:
We launch a request, then we continue to do what we are doing.
So, there's no waiting for reply here/ expectation for a reply,
Thus here we forget about it, we carry on executing the tasks,
and then eventually we might then get a reply.
