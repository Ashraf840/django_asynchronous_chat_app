Project Brief:
    In a chatroom situation, we send a msg to a chatroom, we can see it, 
    everyone else can see it. But we might not get reply. And then, 
    someone eventually might say something. And then that information 
    gets sent back to us. So here we're working in real-time. Asynchronous 
    environment will allow us to work in real-time. We can recieve messages 
    whenever they might occur. 

    Whereas, in HTTP in synchronous way, will only going to recieve the message, 
    when we actually make a request.
